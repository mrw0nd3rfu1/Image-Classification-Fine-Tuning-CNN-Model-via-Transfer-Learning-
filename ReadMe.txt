The project was made for Udacity Advanced Machine Learning Nano Degree.

To check the project in details see the Proposal and Project pdf file in which details of the project are written.

To work on the project-
The module to be installed is keras which is necessary for the execution of the project.
I will include both my python file and ipython notebook file for the review in the code folder.

As for execution-
1. Download the dataset from https://my.pcloud.com/publink/show?code=VZvzMlZyPYO1hSn92LXdzmGNr9y1j7qKDzX
2. The model uploaded is a trained one we can alse re-train it.
3. To train the data just open the fine_tune.py and run it using the commands:
	python code/fine_tune.py <data_dir/> <model_dir/>
4. After Training classify the data model we have trained and make changes in it according to us:
	It can be executed as:
	python code/classify.py <model_dir/> <test_dir/> <results_dir/>
5. The model test and data are in the above links and result can be found by executing the data.
